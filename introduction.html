They should not be adjusted in any way that could lead to misinterpretation of the information in the original image. Unprocessed figure files and data must be retained for editorial review upon request. The descriptions of changes, hardware and software used to take images and make adjustments must also be provided. Inappropriate figure manipulation is grounds for article retraction and/or reporting to institutional oversight boards.<br></li><li>"Figure" refers to all images such as graphs, charts, line drawings and photographs. When citing figures in the text, the abbreviation "Fig." should be used. If the citation is the beginning of the sentence, use the full word "Figure" instead.<br></li><li>All figures must be cited in the main text.<br></li><li>Ideally legends should not be included in your image files. However legends in images are accepted for initial review, when the legend is placed below the image. For revisions, legends in images are not accepted. Single file submissions should include legends in the manuscript text alongside the figure. Multi-file submissions require legends to be entered manually using the 'Details needed’ button, and should not be included in the manuscript text.<br></li><li>Figure legends should be self contained and clearly describe the figure and its contents.<br></li><li>The graphical area of a figure should include information about scales, abbreviations, limits, etc.<br></li><li>When submitting photographs as figures please indicate the identity of the photographer. If the photographer is not one of the co-authors, please upload a supplemental document with permission from the photographer allowing you to publish the image under a CC BY license.<br></li><li>If you use a map as a figure please cite the source of the map. Wherever possible, use map services which allow unrestricted re-use. If you must use Google Earth or Google Maps then in order to accurately attribute a map from Google, we need to know the third-party data providers cited with the map:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/permissions/geoguidelines/attr-guide.html">find out how</a>.<br></li><li>When creating figures and images consider the accessibility of your chosen color schemes to those with non-normal color vision. Wherever possible avoid using color alone to distinguish between parts of images. When color is used, we suggest that you consult the following resources to ensure maximum accessibility:&nbsp;<a href="http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/color/index.html">J*FLY</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/tips-for-color/">Mapbox</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://colorbrewer2.org/">ColorBrewer</a>.<br></li></ul></div></div><div><div><a href="https://peerj.com/about/author-instructions/#lennean-binomials"><b>Linnean Binomials</b></a><ul><li>Authors are encouraged to provide taxonomic authors of Linnean binomials when first used in the text, particularly for taxa that are the focus of the paper in question. Where several taxa are named, citation of taxonomic authors in Tables is regarded as an adequate substitute for citation in the body of the text. Authors of zoological names should consist of initials plus full surnames, whereas authors of botanical names should be abbreviated following Brummitt &amp; Powell's (1992) 'Authors of plant names'. In either case, binomials carrying more than three authors should be abbreviated to 'et al.' subsequent to the name of the third author.<br></li></ul></div></div></div><div><br></div>
